//! Writing to the calculation engine — `TSCE`.
//!
//! Everything else in this crate reads `TSCE` ([`crate::formula`]). This is the
//! one place that writes it, and it writes exactly one thing: the record that
//! says *this cell holds a formula, and these are the cells it reads*.
//!
//! # Why that record is the whole problem
//!
//! Numbers does not recalculate a formula when a document opens. The value in
//! the cell record is what the app shows, and it goes on showing it: a cell
//! given a formula whose cached value belongs to another row was watched
//! reporting that other row's answer, through an open, an edit and a save. Nor
//! does editing a cell the formula reads help — **the engine recalculates what
//! its dependency graph reaches, and a cell nothing registered is not in it**.
//! Watched: with `B2` changed from 1 to 10, the app's own `=SUM($B$2:$B$4)`
//! went from 6 to 15 and the copy of it this crate had put in the next column
//! stayed at 6.
//!
//! # What the app writes for one formula
//!
//! Measured by giving Numbers a blank document, setting `A3` to `=A1+A2`
//! through its own scripting interface, and diffing what came back. Three
//! things changed, and nothing else:
//!
//! ```text
//! owner.cell_dependencies (4) += CellRecordExpandedArchive {
//!     column: 0, row: 2,                          ← A3, the formula's cell
//!     expanded_edges: { rows: [0, 1], columns: [0, 0] }   ← A1 and A2
//! }
//! owner.tiled_cell_dependencies (13) += a new TSCE.CellRecordTileArchive
//!     holding the same record, with the owner id and the tile's origin
//! engine.dependency_tracker.number_of_formulas (2.5) += 1
//! ```
//!
//! The edges are the formula's **precedents**, resolved against the cell that
//! holds it — which is why a relative reference is a different edge in every
//! row, and why the crate has to resolve the AST rather than copy the source's
//! record.
//!
//! What does *not* work, and was tried first: `TSCE.ReferencesToDirtyArchive`,
//! the engine's list of what to recompute, which every document carries and
//! which is empty in every one of them. Naming a cell there — by its owner id,
//! its column and its row — changed nothing at all: the app opened the document
//! and showed the stale value exactly as before. Whatever that list is for, it
//! is not a request.
//!
//! The owner is the table's **cell owner**: of the several
//! `TSCE.FormulaOwnerDependenciesArchive` a table has, the one whose
//! `formula_owner_uid` is the table's `base_owner_uid` — `owner_kind` 1, and
//! the UID every other owner of that table names as its base.
