//! Documents from nothing.
//!
//! [`crate::Document::from_template`] answers "create a document" by copying one
//! that works, which is the rule the rest of this crate lives by — and which
//! needs Apple's software installed to have something to copy. This module owes
//! the other half of the README's promise: a caller with this crate and nothing
//! else gets [`crate::Document::new`], and the bytes come from here.
//!
//! # Why this is allowed to synthesise
//!
//! FORMAT.md's rule is *copy, don't synthesise*, and it is there because
//! inventing a message out of a schema crashed Pages every time it was tried.
//! Nothing below repeals it. What is written here was instead **measured**: a
//! document each app made was reduced — one field, one object, one stream
//! deleted at a time, the app asked after every deletion whether it still opened
//! the result and still read the text back — until nothing more could go. Every
//! object this module writes is one the app was watched insisting on, and
//! everything the app was watched not needing is not written. See FORMAT.md
//! §"The least document each app will open".
//!
//! # The shape of a document
//!
//! Four things, in this order:
//!
//! 1. **Objects**, each an `ArchiveInfo` and its payload, grouped into
//!    **components** — one `Index/<name>.iwa` stream apiece.
//! 2. **The component index**, `Index/Metadata.iwa`: a `TSP.PackageMetadata`
//!    naming every component and declaring every reference that leaves one.
//! 3. **The identity**, `Metadata/Properties.plist` and
//!    `Metadata/DocumentIdentifier`: the UUIDs that say which document this is.
//! 4. **Nothing else.** No previews (the app draws its own), no build history,
//!    no view state — all three apps open a document that has none.
