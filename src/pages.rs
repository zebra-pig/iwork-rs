//! `TP` — the Pages document spine: modes, sections, headers, footers, page
//! templates, footnotes, contents and flows.
//!
//! Only Pages writes these archives, and only Pages has this shape:
//!
//! ```text
//!  TP.DocumentArchive
//!    ├── body_storage (4) ──── TSWP.StorageArchive, kind = body
//!    │                           └── table_section (17): {char index → section}
//!    ├── settings (7) ──────── TP.SettingsArchive: body? headers? footnotes?
//!    ├── page_templates (48) ─ TP.PageTemplateArchive …   (page layout only)
//!    ├── toc_styles (14) ───── TSWP.TOCSettingsArchive …
//!    └── flow_info_container (47) ─ TSWP.FlowInfoContainerArchive
//!                                     └── TSWP.FlowInfoArchive: a linked
//!                                         text-box thread
//!
//!  TP.SectionArchive
//!    ├── first / even / odd section-template page (23, 24, 25)
//!    └── each a TP.SectionTemplateArchive
//!          ├── headers (1): exactly three storages — left, centre, right
//!          ├── footers (2): exactly three more
//!          └── section_template_drawables (3)
//! ```
//!
//! **The schema is twelve years newer than the published one.** Everything
//! called a "page master" in 2013 is a *section template* in 15.3.1 — the type
//! at registry id 10143 is `TP.SectionTemplateArchive`, not the
//! `TP.PageLayoutArchive` this crate used to call it — and six `TP` commands
//! changed superclass. Names here come from the descriptors carved out of the
//! installed 15.3.1 binaries (`reference/protos-15.3/pages/TPArchives.proto`),
//! never from the 2013 tables.
//!
//! ## Where a section begins
//!
//! A section is an entry in the body storage's `table_section` (field 17),
//! anchored like a paragraph: at the character **after** the `U+0004` that
//! begins it, not on the break itself. The first section starts at 0 with no
//! break in front of it. So section *i* covers `[start_i, start_{i+1} - 1)` —
//! the break belongs to no section's text — and the last runs to the end.
//!
//! That is checked against the app: Pages reports `body text of section 1…3`
//! of `pages-report` as 145, 923 and 432 characters, and the entries are at 0,
//! 146 and 1070 in a 1502-unit storage. 146−0−1 = 145, 1070−146−1 = 923,
//! 1502−1070 = 432.
