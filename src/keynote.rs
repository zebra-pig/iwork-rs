//! `KN` — the Keynote show: slides, layouts, placeholders, notes, transitions.
//!
//! Only Keynote writes these archives, and the numbering is **app-scoped**: a
//! Keynote type 5 is `KN.SlideArchive` and a Numbers type 5 is something else
//! entirely. [`crate::registry`] resolves them per document kind; nothing here
//! may be used on a document [`crate::Document::kind`] does not call Keynote.

//!
//! ## A slide is a component
//!
//! Each slide is its own `Index/Slide*.iwa` stream and its own component, whose
//! identifier is the `KN.SlideArchive`'s own; each layout is an
//! `Index/TemplateSlide-*.iwa`. The slide's *node* lives in `Index/Document.iwa`
//! with the show. That split is what makes duplicating a slide a package
//! operation rather than an object one — see [`duplicate_slide`].
//!
//! ## What "showing" means
//!
//! Keynote's `title showing` and `body showing` are not flags. A placeholder is
//! shown when the slide **owns** it — when it appears in `owned_drawables` (7) —
//! and the reference at field 5 or 6 stays whatever the layout gave it either
//! way. That is measured, not assumed: over the six slides of `keynote-deck`
//! the app's `title showing` / `body showing` agree with membership of field 7
//! twelve times out of twelve, including the "Statement" slide whose title
//! placeholder still holds text the app does not draw.
//!
//! ## Slide numbers
//!
//! A skipped slide has no number. The app answers `slide number` with **-1** for
//! it, and numbers the rest 1, 2, 3 … skipping over it — so the number is a
//! function of the deck, not a field on the slide. [`Slide::number`] is `None`
//! for a skipped slide for exactly that reason.
