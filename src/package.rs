//! The package container shared by Pages, Numbers and Keynote, in its two

//!
//! iWork relies on entries being uncompressed so media can be mapped straight
//! out of the file, and the `Index/*.iwa` payloads carry their own Snappy
//! compression, so deflating them again would only cost CPU. All three apps
//! behave identically here.
//!
//! The two shapes are two content types rather than a detail of storage.
//! `mdls` on the same document written both ways answers
//! `com.apple.iwork.pages.sffpages` for the file — *single-file format* — and
//! `com.apple.iwork.pages.pages`, conforming to `com.apple.package` and
//! `public.directory`, for the directory. What is inside is identical: the same
//! entry names, the same bytes.
