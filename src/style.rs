//! Text styles — the objects a run of text points at.
//!
//! A `TSWP.StorageArchive` carries no formatting of its own. What it carries is
//! attribute tables, and every one of them has the same shape: entries of
//! `{1: character_index, 2: reference}`, strictly increasing by index, each run
//! reaching to the next entry. The objects those references land on are the
//! styles:
//!
//! | Storage field | Points at | Message type |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 5 | paragraph styles | 2022 `TSWP.ParagraphStyleArchive` |
//! | 7 | list styles | 2023 `TSWP.ListStyleArchive` |
//! | 8 | character styles | 2021 `TSWP.CharacterStyleArchive` |
//!
//! The tables are the solid part. Their shape is asserted by the test suite,
//! it is the same in all three apps, and everything in this module that
//! *changes* which style applies to which text works on them alone.
//!
//! What a style archive **contains** was worked out by experiment rather than
//! assumed — see [`property`]. What is not in that list is left unnamed rather
//! than guessed at: a wrong field number writes wrong bytes, where a wrong name
//! in [`crate::registry`] only prints wrong. So a style is handled as what it
//! demonstrably is — a tree of wire fields you can read, address by path and
//! rewrite — and new styles are made by **copying one that already works**,
//! which is the rule `FORMAT.md` gives for whole documents and for the same
//! reason.
//!
//! `iwork style <file> <id>` prints that tree with the path of every field, so
//! the numbers can be discovered from the document at hand rather than assumed.
